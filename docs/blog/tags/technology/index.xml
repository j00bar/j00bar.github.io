      <description>This month, Twitter disabled SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for users who have not paid Musk&amp;rsquo;s $8 fee for Twitter Blue.

My eldest niece was three or four years old at the time, and I was fortunate when my work included regular transcontinental business trips to be able to visit them once or twice a year. Like many of us, they owned an Amazon Echo, which my niece was allowed to request to play music. The living room was frequently filled with endless loops of the Thomas &amp;amp; Friends theme song as well as selections from the Frozen soundtrack.</description>
