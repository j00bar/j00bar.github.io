      <description>In my coding work for SeekHealing, we make extensive use of the Django Admin for our program management database. For a one-person coding team, Django has been invaluable for maintaining a functional, accessible system that evolves with the program&amp;rsquo;s needs despite the limited number of hours I have to devote to the work.
We manage our calendar of program events in Django, with a model appropriately called CalendarEvent, which has a start-time and an end-time - and we&amp;rsquo;ve got data in this database going back to 2018.</description>

      <title>Twitter ditches SMS as 2FA for non-paying users</title>

      <description>Effective next month, Twitter will disable SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for users who have not paid Musk&amp;rsquo;s $8 fee for Twitter Blue.
Source: Twitter Musk claims that Twitter is spending $60M on fraudulent SMS challenges from a longstanding practice known as Toll Fraud, where bad-acting telcos who charge high rates for delivering SMS messages surreptitiously use bots to force generation such SMS verification messages to inflate their bills. While Toll Fraud is undoubtedly a real thing that I have no doubt Twitter wastes a lot of money on, I won&amp;rsquo;t take the $60M figure at face value because the fact remains that most 2FA challenges are probably malicious because that&amp;rsquo;s 2FA working as designed.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, I was visiting my brother and his family in their San Francisco home. My eldest niece was three or four years old at the time, and I was fortunate when my work included regular transcontinental business trips to be able to visit them once or twice a year. Like many of us, they owned an Amazon Echo, which my niece was allowed to request to play music. The living room was frequently filled with endless loops of the Thomas &amp;amp; Friends theme song as well as selections from the Frozen soundtrack.</description>
